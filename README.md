# OhioBot
Code to help manage the Hip Hop Gamers Discord

Functionality:
* Tracks count of messages sent by users
* Tracks number of times users ask to play Counter Strike
* Converts from EST to PST as needed, and makes fun of PST users

Featuring:
* SQLite3 to manage a database
* Discord API to connect to a specified server
* Unsecure SQL code that is probably liable to injection

Next Steps:
* Host this file on AWS
* Integrate new method to store details using MongoDB instead of SQLite3
