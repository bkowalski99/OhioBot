# OhioBot
Code to help manage the Hip Hop Gamers Discord

Functionality:
* Tracks count of messages sent by users
* Tracks number of times users ask to play Counter Strike
* Converts from EST to PST as needed, and makes fun of PST users

Featuring:
* SQLite3 to manage a database
* Discord API to connect to a DB
* Unsecure SQL code that is probably liable to injection

Next Steps:
* Introducing shell method to allow for the bot to be stopped, updated, and started
* More robust security to patch the injection concerns
* More secrets
